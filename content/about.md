# Our Story

We all are in the midst of a climate and ecological breakdown. We are facing an uncertain future â€“ our world is in crisis and life itself is under threat. 

There is no time and every single step can make a change: on the street, on the web, and behind that web. At Faircolibri we are experienced IT engineers and we are active for the climate. We want to use that experience to help organisations reduce carbon footprint, and promote via their IT climate justice and inclusivity.
